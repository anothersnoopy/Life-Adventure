## 休对故人思故国，且将新火试新茶

+ look at [score-plan.md](https://github.com/anothersnoopy/Life-Adventure/blob/master/score-plan.md) to get the latest scores plan.

-----

##  About this program:
**It can(now)** :
+ record your daily life
+ analyze your Health, Energy and Spirit level by multi-factors
+ make a plan and check finish.
+ Set a dream and display the date your dream may come true.(Beta)


**I  (may) will add these features in the future**: 
+ randomly put some good sentences into your diary(be self-motivated) .



----


## How to use it:

### Install:
1. This project is devloped with C++, so you need a C++ compiler.

2. Edit the PATHs in the function.cpp. 
> PATH: for your diary; 

> PATH_data: for diary data(you needn't to know what exactly it is); 

> PATH_plan: for your daily plan.

* I Personally recommend you to set the 'PATH' to your OneDrive (or any other sync service you have ) file folder directory so that your diary can automatically sync.*

3. Once you have a C++ compiler, compile it and run. For example, on linux if you have g++ , use these comand lines:

>`g++ main.cpp -o run`

>`./run`

### Usage:
1. If you have already run the program, There should be messages on the screen, follow them.
2. If you have finished making a plan, type 'over' to quit.
3. The diary will be writed following Markdown grammar, so you'd better open it by a Markdown editor, I personally suggest 'Typora' on Windows.
