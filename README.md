##  About this program:

**It can(now)** :
+ record your daily life
+ analyze your Health, Energy and Spirit level by multi-factors

**I  (may) will add these features in the future**: 
+ set a dream (for instance: By a Macbook pro) and set conditions( eg: Energy reaches 100%, or sport scores reached 500) . If you meet the condition, buy it!
+ add new features: write notes in the diary.
+ randomly put some good sentences into your diary(be self-motivated) .

## How to use it:
1. This project is devloped with C++, so you need a C++ compiler. // 首先，你需要一个C++编译器

2. Edit the PATH(where you want your diary stay) in the function.cpp //然后，你想把日记存在哪？在function.cpp里更改PATH路径参数即可

3. Once you have a C++ compiler, compile it and run. For example, on linux if you have g++ , use these comandline:
//利用编译器编译、执行。例如：如果你在linux上使用g++编译器，输入以下命令：

`g++ main.cpp -o run`

`./run`

4. The diary will be writed following Markdown grammar, so you'd better open it by a Markdown editor, I personally suggest 'Typora' on Windows. //日记会自动输出为遵循Markdown语法的文本，因此我建议你最好用Markdown编辑器打开/浏览你的日记，我个人建议在windows平台上使用Typora软件，一款很不错的Markdown软件。
