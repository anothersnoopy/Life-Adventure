## 休对故人思故国，且将新火试新茶

+ look at [score-plan.md](https://github.com/anothersnoopy/Life-Adventure/blob/master/score-plan.md) to get the latest scores plan.

-----

##  About this program:
**It can(now)** :
+ record your daily life
+ analyze your Health, Energy and Spirit level by multi-factors

**I  (may) will add these features in the future**: 
+ set a dream (for instance: Buy a Macbook pro) and set conditions( eg: Energy reaches 100%, or sport scores reached 500) . If you meet the condition, buy it!

+ add new features: write notes in the diary.
+ randomly put some good sentences into your diary(be self-motivated) .



----


## How to use it:
1. This project is devloped with C++, so you need a C++ compiler.

2. Edit the PATH(where you want your diary stay) in the function.cpp. I Personally recommend you to set the 'PATH' to your OneDrive (or any other sync service you have ) file folder directory so that your diary can automatically sync.

3. Once you have a C++ compiler, compile it and run. For example, on linux if you have g++ , use these comand lines:

>`g++ main.cpp -o run`

>`./run`
4. The diary will be writed following Markdown grammar, so you'd better open it by a Markdown editor, I personally suggest 'Typora' on Windows.

## How to personalize this program
+ [manual.md](https://github.com/anothersnoopy/Life-Adventure/blob/master/manual.md) could tell you how to add new functions in this program.
